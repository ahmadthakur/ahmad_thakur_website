Have you ever wondered what makes you, you? Is it your experiences, your memories or something more intangible? Was religion right all along, and it's the soul that makes you who you are?

The idea for this video came to me recently when I was reading this amazing novel by author Blake Crouch, called "Recursion". Without spoiling much, imagine a machine that can send your consciousness back in time. From the point of view of the person, he has basically time travelled, and he can now change the past to affect future events.

But in this particular story, there is a side effect of this memory time travel. When you change the past, you're not just altering future events. You're creating an entirely new timeline of memories for everyone else involved. And when the clock catches up to the moment you jumped back, everyone gets hit with a tidal wave of memories from a life they never actually lived. But a life now they remember in vivid detail.

These memories are equally real because the events have happened. But they haven't happened in the new timeline the people are in and so it leads to a sort of cognitive dissonance. Which memory is real and which is not? What actually happened and what didn't? In one sense, these memories are 100% real. The events happened. You lived them. You felt every emotion, experienced every moment. But in your current timeline? They're phantom experiences, echoes of a life that never was.

The main point of the book and this video is not about time travel, but about the nature of memory and how it shapes our sense of self. Think about it – how would you cope if you woke up tomorrow and found out your parents had been dead for 15 years, when you clearly remember having dinner with them last night? Your brain would be doing mental gymnastics trying to reconcile two conflicting realities. Which "you" is the real one?

## The Building Blocks of Identity

From this thought experiment we transition from the topic of memory to the topic of consciousness. From the moment we're born, our brains start collecting experiences, forming memories, and building the foundation of who we'll become.

As children, we start to develop what psychologists call "autobiographical memory" - the ability to recall specific events from our personal past. This usually begins around age 3 or 4, and it's a crucial step in forming our sense of self. 

Think about your earliest clear memory. Maybe it's your first day of school, or a family vacation, or even something as simple as playing with a favorite toy. That memory, and all the ones that followed, are the building blocks of your identity. They're not just events that happened to you; they're the experiences that shaped you, molded your personality, and influenced your beliefs and values.

Imagine if those foundational memories were different. What if, instead of growing up in a bustling city, you had childhood memories of life on a quiet farm? Instead of remembering struggles with math homework, you recalled excelling at it? Would you still be the same "you"?

This brings us to the question about the nature of consciousness itself. Some philosophers and neuroscientists argue that consciousness is essentially a collection of memories and experiences. Your sense of being a continuous, coherent "self" is built on the scaffold of your personal history.

If this is true, then altering your memories - as in our time travel scenario or in cases of false memories - doesn't just change what you remember. It fundamentally changes who you are. Your personality, your fears, your aspirations - all of these are shaped by your experiences and the memories you've formed from them.

So, if you went through different events and formed different memories, would you become the "you" you are now? The answer is likely no. You'd still be "you" in the sense of being the same physical person, the atoms that make your physical structure, but your personality, your beliefs, your very sense of self would be profoundly different.

## When Reality Glitches

You might be thinking, this is some great science fiction material, but why does it matter? It doesn't actually happen. Well, there is where you might be wrong because there have been instances where things like this have happened, that fundamentally changed people and made them believe things about themselves or the world that weren't true.

Firstly, there's the Mandela effect. It's when an entire population believes something happened when it didn't. The Mandela effect got its name in 2009 by Fiona Broome, after she discovered that she, along with a number of others, believed that Nelson Mandela had died in the 1980s (he actually died in 2013).

One of the most well-known examples of the Mandela Effect in pop culture, is the collective memory of a movie called "Shazam" that starred the actor Sinbad in the 1990s. In fact, no such movie exists, although there were a children's movie called Kazaam starring Shaquille O'Neal.

Many people might also remember Pikachu having a black-tipped tail. In reality, Pikachu has always had a solid yellow tail. I know at one point when I was a kid I had that idea because I routinely drew Pikachu with a black tip. I don’t know where it came from though. It probably came from a combination of Pichu having a black tail, and our young brains confusing between the two.

Another example is Mickey Mouse. People often report the character wearing suspenders when in reality he does not. The original Mickey is wearing shorts, but is completely unclothed on the top half of his body. Maybe people confused him with Mario who does indeed have suspenders. 

Why is it that we remember these things so clearly when they never happened? Why is our brain creating these connections? Is it trying to sabotage our sense of self on purpose? What if we didn't have the ways to verify what we consider as facts in our heads? Would we as a population have propagated the fake memories in our head? Entire generations believing int something that never was?

There is this image in a children's history book which always fascinated me. It shows how stories of events evolve and get exaggerated over time, and eventually become something they never were.

What's even more concerning is the fact that false memories can be implanted in people. There have been many cases in the past such as The Satanic Panic of the 1980s and The Case of Paul Ingram in 1988, which used Suggestive questioning, emotional trauma and suggestive therapy techniques to make people believe in things that never happened. These things had real legal implications. False memories that lead to wrongful convictions or false accusations.

## Modern Concerns

And now we have AI. Deep fakes and video generators which generate content so close to reality that it is already hard to tell what is real and what is fake. In a few years time, we won't even be able to trust the very technology we created for preserving facts.

We also now have technology such as the Neuralink. While Neuralink's goals are medical and technological advancement, it's not hard to imagine how a technology that directly interfaces with the brain can be weaponized. There is potential for misuse in terms of memory manipulation.

## The Big Questions

So where does this leave us? If our memories shape our identity, and our memories can be manipulated or fabricated, what does that mean for our sense of self?

As technology advances and our understanding of the brain grows, this question can become more than just a philosophical idea. It can have real-world implications for psychology, law, and even our fundamental human rights.

In the end, maybe the most important thing isn't having perfect, unalterable memories. Maybe it's being aware of how fragile our sense of reality can be.
