Skepticism argues that knowledge does not exist because we could all be brains in a vat dreaming a reality around us. Because from the point of view of the brain, it is not aware that it is in a simulated world. Skeptics argue, that since we can't know that we are brains in a vat, therefore we can't have knowledge about anything else either. And since we can't have knowledge about anything, discussion about what **true knowledge** is, is kind of moot.

To be honest, this is a valid argument. But there is a counterargument to this. Even if we are living in a simulation and can't possibly have knowledge about the reality, there might be certain rules that the simulation itself is working on. And maybe we can have knowledge about these rules or laws even though they might be limited in explaining the true reality of everything. More importantly, we can have knowledge about our existence, because we are aware of our existence.
**Descartes's method for philosophical reasoning**.

In the though experiment **The Allegory of the Cave**, **Plato** kind of sets up a somewhat similar situation. The prisoners inside have no knowledge of the outside world and their entire knowledge about everything is just the shadows on the wall. Even so, they do have knowledge of the existence of the shadows at least and maybe also know of the timings of certain shadows. They could use that knowledge in their daily lives somehow to influence the world around them. Which is to say, having limited or flawed knowledge is better than no knowledge.
